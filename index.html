      <h3>Feb 3, 2020</h3>
      <p>Today was a classic work day. On these days, I start with snoozing my alarm at least 5 times before finally mustering up the strength to get out of bed. Once I've gotten myself up, I'll head to my bathroom to start getting ready for the day. Thankfully, I've gotten my work day morning routine down to about 40-45 minutes. Around 8am, I find myself running around the house gathering the last few things before heading out the door and driving to work.</p>

      <p>My work day officially begins at 9am, after a 15-20 minute nap in my car (what else are you gonna do when you make it to work super early?) At this point in the day, I typically have my first meal. If I'm being good I'll have something along the lines of two hardboiled eggs and 2 slices of turkey bacon with a protein smoothie, but sadly today I was way behind. Instead, I held out for a while and found myself snacking on my day's lunch around 11am.</p>

      <p>As soon as 5pm comes along, I'm free to spend the evening as I'd like. Today, I chose to head home, cook myself a little dinner, and spend the rest of the evening working on this programming class. So proud.</p>

      <h3>Feb 2, 2020</h3>
      <p>Wow y'all, it's the weekend! Sunday is one of my favorite days of the week - it can either be super relaxing or super productive, but either way very enjoyable. When I'm being disaplined I'll make the most of a free day before a long work week. I typically like to wake up slowly, on my own time (no alarms on the weekend!) From there, I'll try to clean up my room and house, go grocery shopping for the upcoming week, make some food for lunches for the week and dinner that night, and end the day relaxing and watching netflix.</p>

      <p>That's absolutely my ideal Sunday. However, when you work a full-time job and get home only a few hours before your bedtime, and decided to take an awesome Introduction to Programming course, you don't always get that Sunday plan day. That was my day today, programming. Instead of driving to the grocery store, I drove to Starbucks, ordered a large coffee, and pulled out my laptop. The day was super productive and really fun, and now I'm exhausted and my poor brain is done working.</p>

      <h1>Meet Me, Gen!</h1>
      <p>Hey all, I'm Gen (hi!) I'm a native Portlander that went on a crazy 10 year traveling stint before moving back home. I currently work at the cutest Real Estate company that I love, but I'm excited to begin a new chapter of my life and try programming. I've always been described by my friends as the techy one in the group. I worked a short time in state government in the IT division, which basically means I know my way around a printer. I haven't done much programming in my past, but I took one web design class in college and fell in love with HTML and CSS coding.</p>
